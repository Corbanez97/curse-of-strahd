### Souls and Shells
- About one in every ten Barovians have souls.
- When a being with a soul dies, the soul remains trapped in [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s domain until it is reincarnated in a newborn.
- It can take decades for a bodiless soul to find a host.
- Barovians who share the same soul over generations tend to look alike.
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] needs loyal subjects with souls to feed his ego.
- Barovians without souls are empty shells created by his consciousness to fill out the local population.
- Although they are physically indistinguishable from Barovians with souls, they tend to be bereft of charm and imagination and to be more compliant and depressed than the others.
- A Barovian woman, soulless or not, can give birth. A child born in Barovia might have a soul even if one or both parents do not.
- Conversely, the child of two parents with souls isn't certain to have a soul of its own.
- Barovians without souls are maudlin folk who experience fear but neither laugh nor cry.
- [[Ireena Kolyana]] and her brother Ismark both have souls, as do all [[Vistanis]]. Which Barovians have souls and which don't is left up to you.
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] periodically feeds on the blood of Barovians who have souls but can't draw nourishment from the blood of the soulless.
- If [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is defeated, the [[The Lands of Barovia#Mists of Ravenloft|fog that surrounds Barovia]] fades away, allowing the inhabitants of the valley to leave if they wish.
- Only those who have souls can truly leave this place. Soulless Barovians cease to exist as soon as they exit the valley.

### Barovians and Nonhumans
- Barovians are human.
- Although they know that dwarves, elves, halflings, and other civilized races exist, few living Barovians have seen such "creatures," let alone interacted with them.
- Aside from the secretive dusk elves of [[Town of Vallaki]] (see chapter 5), the only nonhumans most Barovians are familiar with are the adventurers that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has lured to his dark realm.
- Barovians thus react to nonhuman characters the same way most humans in the real world would react to elf, dwarf, or half-orc adventurers suddenly walking the streets.
- Most such outsiders are scorned, feared, or shunned.

### Barovian Lore
- **Source:** p26
- Typical Barovians know certain facts or have certain beliefs about their existence and their surroundings.
- This common lore is summarized here.
- Characters can learn this information after earning a Barovian's trust.

#### The Devil [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]
- About [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and vampires, the Barovians believe the following:
- [[Strahd von Zarovich]] is a vampire and dwells in [[Castle Ravenloft]].
- No one is welcome at the castle.
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|The Devil Strahd]] is a curse placed on the land because of a forgotten sin of the Barovians' ancestors (This is untrue, but Barovians believe it nonetheless).

- A vampire must rest in its coffin during the day. At night, it can summon wolves and vermin to do its bidding. A vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, or a cloud of mist. In its humanoid form, it can dominate you with its powerful gaze.
- A vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
- Running water burns a vampire like acid, and sunlight causes a vampire to burst into flame.

#### The Land of Barovia

- Barovians know the following facts about their homeland:
- Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog. Those who don't turn back perish.
- Many strangers have been drawn to Barovia over the years, but they all die or disappear before long.
- Wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves prowl the Svalich Woods, and hungry bats fill the skies at night.
- The village of Barovia sits at the east end of the valley. Its burgomaster is named Kolyan Indirovich.
- The town of Vallaki lies in the heart of the valley. Its burgomaster is named Baron Vargas Vallakovich.
- The fortified village of Krezk lies at the west end of the valley and is built around an old abbey. The village burgomaster is named Dmitri Krezkov.
- Wine is the lifeblood of Baroviaâ€”for some, it is the only reason to keep living. Barovian taverns get their wine from the Wizard of Wines winery near Krezk.
- A mad wizard of great power haunts the foothills of Mount Baratok. He is an outsider and no friend of the vampire's.

#### Barovian Calendar

- Barovia has its own calendar, and Barovians are accustomed to measuring the passage of time in "moons" instead of months.
- Each moon begins on the first night of a full moon and lasts a full lunar cycle.
- A year consists of twelve moons, or twelve lunar cycles.
- [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] was born in 306. In 346, he inherited his father's crown, lands, and army. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] conquered the valley in 347, finished construction of [[Castle Ravenloft]] in 350, and died and became a vampire in 351.
- The current year is 735.

#### Beliefs and Superstitions

- Barovians have deep-rooted religious beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:
- Two divine forces watch over the Barovian people: the [[Morninglord]] and [[Mother Night]].
- Before the curse of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] befell the land, the [[Morninglord]] watched over the Barovian people from sunrise until sundown. Now, the sun has not shone unobscured for centuries, and the [[Morninglord]] no longer answers their prayers.
- The presence of [[Mother Night]] is felt most strongly between dusk and dawn, although nighttime prayers to her go unanswered. It is widely believed that she has forsaken the Barovian people and sent the devil [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] to punish them for their ancestors' offenses.
- Spirits drift along the [[The Old Svalich Road]] toward [[Castle Ravenloft]] in the dead of night. These phantoms are all that remain of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s enemies, and this damnable fate awaits anyone who opposes him.
- The [[Vistanis|Vistani]] serve the devil [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. They alone are allowed to leave [[The Lands of Barovia|Barovia]].
- Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you!
