- In life, Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family's enemies, naming the valley Barovia after his deceased father.
- Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd, who had become cold and arrogant due to war. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield.
- Peace made Strahd restless, leading him to study magic and forge a pact with the Dark Powers of the [[Shadowfell]] in return for immortality.
- Strahd built [[Castle Ravenloft]] in [[The Lands of Barovia | Barovia]] and named it after his mother, but Ravenovia died on her way to the castle.
- Strahd's attention turned to [[Tatyana]], a young Barovian woman, whom he believed to be a worthy bride. She fell in love with Sergei, and Strahd's jealousy led to Sergei's murder and [[Tatyana|Tatyana's]] death.
- Strahd became a vampire through a pact with the Dark Powers after these events.
- Strahd has been the master of [[Castle Ravenloft|Ravenloft]] for centuries, taking several consorts, all turned into vampire spawn.
- Strahd seeks to find someone worthy to rule in his stead to escape [[The Lands of Barovia | Barovia]] but believes only a von Zarovich could sway the Dark Powers to release him.
