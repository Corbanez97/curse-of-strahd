The idyllic valley nestled in the Balinok Mountains was a slice of heaven to those who knew of its existence before [[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s arrival. The serenity of the place was forever shattered when [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] led a bloody crusade against the enemies of his family that ended here with the slaughter of hundreds. Struck by the scenic beauty of his most recent conquest and eager to escape the shadow of his father's legacy, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] made the valley his home and named it Barovia after the late King Barov, his father.

The land now called Barovia is no longer part of the world that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] once tried to conquer. It now exists within a demiplane formed by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s consciousness and surrounded by a deadly fog. No creature can leave without [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s permission, and those that try become lost in the mist.

[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] allows the [[Vistanis|Vistani]] to come and go as they please because he admires their lust for life and their willingness to serve him when he needs them. He also owes an ancient debt to the [[Vistanis|Vistani]] people. As a soldier centuries ago, he suffered a grievous injury in battle, and the [[Vistanis|Vistani]] tended his wounds and returned him safely to his family without making any demand for payment. The [[Vistanis|Vistani]] claim to possess potions that allow them to leave [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s domain, but the potions are false concoctions with no magical power. Nevertheless, the [[Vistanis|Vistani]] are willing to sell them for a hefty price.

Native [[Barovians]] have been terrorized for centuries by the one they call "the devil [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]." Only a handful of them have the will to oppose him. [[Barovians]] congregate in the valley's three main settlements—the villages of [[Village of Barovia|Barovia]] and [[Village of Krezk|Krezk]] and the [[Town of Vallaki]]—for fear of falling prey to wolves and other beasts that prowl the woods. Among these people are the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens. Not powerful enough to defeat [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] on their own, the Keepers readily assist adventurers who find themselves drawn into [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s domain.

“_My army settled in the valley of [[The Lands of Barovia|Barovia]] and took power over the people in the name of a just god, but with none of a god's grace or justice._”

# Lay of the Land

Rolling thunderclouds cast a gray pall over the land of [[The Lands of Barovia|Barovia]]. A deathly stillness hangs over the dark woods, which are patrolled constantly by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s wolves and other servitors.

The evergreen trees of [[The Svalich Woods]] climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. The largest of these peaks is [[Mount Baratok]], with its snow-covered cap and rugged slopes. [[Mount Baratok|Baratok's]] slightly smaller twin, [[Mount Ghakis]], is mostly bald with tufts of trees here and there. Between these two mountains stands [[Lake Zarovich]], which is fed by streams of ice-cold water pouring down the face of [[Mount Baratok]]. On the south side of the lake rests the [[Town of Vallaki]], enclosed by a palisade. West of the two mountains, atop a hill, stands the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]], around which the [[Barovians]] built a walled village named [[Village of Krezk|Krezk]]. Between [[Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and [[Village of Krezk|Krezk]] lie [[The Ruins of Argynvostholt]], the fallen bastion of a knightly order called [[The Order of the Silver Dragon]], wiped out by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and his army. East of the mountains lies the [[Village of Barovia]], shrouded in mist and bereft of walls and defenses. The dark silhouette of [[Castle Ravenloft]] looks down on this village from its perch atop a 1,000-foot-high column of rock known as [[The Pillarstone of Ravenloft]].

## Mists of Ravenloft

A deadly fog surrounds [[The Lands of Barovia]] and engulfs any creature that tries to leave. Even flying creatures are subject to the fog's effects, which are as follows:

- A creature that starts its turn in the fog must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [[Conditions#Exhausted | Exhaustion]]. This [[Conditions#Exhausted | Exhaustion]] can't be removed while the creature is in the fog.
- No matter how far a creature travels in the fog, or in which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually finds itself back in [[The Lands of Barovia | Barovia]].
- The area within the fog is heavily obscured (see [[Vision and Light]])

## Sunlight in Barovia

By the will of the Dark Powers, the sun never fully shines in the lands of Barovia. Even during the day, the sky is dimmed by fog or storm clouds, or the light is strangely muted. Barovian daylight is bright light, yet it isn't considered sunlight for the purpose of effects and vulnerabilities, such as a vampire's, tied to sunlight.

Nevertheless, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and his vampire spawn tend to stay indoors most of the day and venture out at night, and they are subject to sunlight created by magic.
